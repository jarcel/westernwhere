# Western Where Records

A single-page website originally built in 2015 for Western Where Records, a small 45 RPM vinyl record label based in Michigan.

## History

This site was created in 2015 to showcase the label's two releases:
- **Autumn Nicole Wetli** - "I Still Go On"
- **Craig Brown** - "Shoulda Been Fishin'"

The label has since closed, but the site remains as a portfolio piece.

## Original Stack (2015)

- AngularJS 1.x
- Gulp + Bower build system
- SASS with modular partials
- Plangular (SoundCloud player)
- OnePageScroll (scroll-jacking plugin)
- Express.js backend with MailChimp integration
- PayPal shopping cart

## Modern Stack (2025)

The site was modernized while preserving all original styling and visual behavior:

- **React 18** + TypeScript
- **Vite** build system
- **SASS** with modern `@use`/`@forward` syntax
- **Custom audio player** using HTML5 Audio API (local MP3s)
- **Static site** (no backend required)
- **WebP images** for better compression
- **GitHub Pages** deployment
